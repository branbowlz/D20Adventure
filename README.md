# d20Adventure
Created with CodeSandbox
Welcome to my d20 adenture game! This is a simple game that will pit your roll against an evil monster's roll
Hopefully you can roll higher than the monster and win!
This game has 1 of three results. Either you win, lose or tie with the monster

Planned changes for this project:
Add a win counter for player and computer
Add an hp bar for player
Add extra text if the player or monster gets a nat 20 such as "WHAM! You landed a crushing blow, defeaating the monster instantly!"
Hide the intial victory results from players. Gotta keep that suspense after all
